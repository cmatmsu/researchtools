# researchtools
academic reasearch-oriented scripts and configurations for open source &amp; free tools. The learning curve is steep and rewarding.

## dependencies
This is being cobbled together using mac osx capitan 10.11.6 and it presupposes that you have the following:
* xcode with commandline tools
* mactex
* homebrew
    * python2 and python3
    * pandoc
    * the silver searcher
    * pdftk
    * ocrmypdf
    * tree
    * unpaper
    * pandoc-citeproc
    * tesseract
    * gnu coreutils
    * par
* vim and/or macvim (Just about any text editor will do, just with a different workflow)
    * vim-pandoc
    * vim-pandoc-syntax
    * ack.vim
