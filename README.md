# researchtools
academic reasearch-oriented scripts and configurations for open source &amp; free tools. The learning curve is steep and rewarding. One of the motivations is to save time int he production of consumable goods in an academic context. Syllabi, letters, handouts, essays, slideshow presentations, etc.  Another is to collect tools that can help to streamline one's workflows.

## dependencies
This is being cobbled together using OSX Capitan 10.11.6 and it presupposes that you have the software listed below. This can probably work in macOS (10.12.x+) without too much trouble. This will probably also work in many a flavor of Linux. Whether this can work under Windows or other operating system is left up to you.

* xcode with commandline tools
* mactex
* homebrew
    * python2 and python3
    * pandoc
    * the silver searcher
    * pdftk
    * ocrmypdf
    * tree
    * unpaper
    * pandoc-citeproc
    * tesseract
    * gnu coreutils
