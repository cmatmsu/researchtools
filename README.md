# researchtools
academic reasearch-oriented scripts and configurations for open source &amp; free tools. The learning curve is steep and rewarding. One of the motivations is to save time int he production of consumable goods in an academic context. Syllabi, letters, handouts, essays, slideshow presentations, etc.  Another is to collect tools that can help to streamline one's workflows.
